# 👥 Java Employee Database CLI

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) Java application for managing employee records. It allows users to list, add, update, and remove employees using a text-based menu system.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate basic Java programming concepts including:

- Class and package structure
- User input handling with `Scanner`
- Method organization
- Menu-driven programs
- Separation of concerns with utility classes (e.g. `EmployeeDetails`)

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ View a list of employees  
- ✅ Add a new employee  
- 🚧 Update employee info *(in progress)*  
- 🚧 Remove employee *(in progress)*

- Scanner for user input  
- Custom package: `employee_pkg`  
- Console-based interface
- Eclipse IDE

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.java` files.

2. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher).

3. Compile and run the program:
   ```bash
   javac employee_pkg/*.java
   java employee_pkg.employees

4. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the employee database.

## 🛣 Future Improvements
Implement updateEmployee() and deleteEmployee() functionality

Save and load employee data from a file or database

Add input validation and error handling

Create unit tests for the methods

## 📌 Notes
This is a personal learning project focused on building comfort with core Java, especially with object-oriented principles and basic CRUD logic.
